Project Name: LetsTextify

Description:
Welcome to LetsTextify, a project developed as the final year project for BE (Computer Engineering). This project is designed to address the challenges of digitizing manual content by providing an efficient solution for text extraction from images.

In today's digital era, converting physical documents like book pages into digital format often requires significant manual effort. LetsTextify offers a faster and easier way to accomplish this task. By utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology and image processing techniques, this project enables the automatic identification of text content from images.

Key Platform and Tools Used:

C# Windows Form for the user interface
C# Class Library serving as a Wrapper DLL for OCR and Image Processing
Tesseract for OCR functionality
EMGUCV for Image PreProcessing
ZXing for QR code reading
MySQL Database
Abstract:
The LetsTextify project aims to streamline the conversion of physical documents into digital format. With the use of OCR, it efficiently extracts text from images, eliminating the need for manual transcription. Whether you have a single page or multiple pages of the same type, LetsTextify can be the perfect solution.

The process is straightforward; you provide an image as input, and the OCR operation processes the image to return the extracted text. Moreover, the project offers the convenience of batch processing, allowing you to convert multiple pages at once into a word format.

Choosing this project as the final year project was driven by the desire to take on challenges and create a practical solution for digitizing content. LetsTextify represents a valuable tool for simplifying text extraction from images and contributes to the ever-growing field of digital transformation.
